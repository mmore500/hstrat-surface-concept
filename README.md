## Installation

`python3 -m pip install "git+https://github.com/mmore500/hstrat-surface-concept.git@v0.2.1#egg=hsurf"`

## Documentation

Slide deck & graphics for this project are at <https://hopth.ru/ce>.
Some notes are in the template manuscript skeleton in `tex/`, which is built via GitHub actions and can be downloaded as an artifact.

See `binder` for usage examples.

## Roadmap

This repository hosts prototype code for algorithm development of a lightweight fixed-length hereditary stratigraphy data structure.

Code here is designed for use in conjunction with the mainline [`hstrat` package](https://github.com/mmore500/hstrat).
Long-term, code in this repository will migrate to the `hstrat` package and this will remain only to ensure records (and reproducibility) of prototype work.


## Credits

This package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [mmore500/cookiecutter-dishtiny-project][https://github.com/mmore500/cookiecutter-dishtiny-project] project template.

<!---
This package uses [Empirical](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical#readme), a library of tools for scientific software development, with emphasis on also being able to build web interfaces using Emscripten.
