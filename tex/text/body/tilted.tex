\section{Tilted Algorithm} \label{sec:tilted}

The tilted criterion favors recent data items, enjoining a record spaced proportionally to time elapsed since data item's ingest time, $\colorT - \colorTbar$.
This is opposite the stretched criterion, which favors early data items.
The tilted criterion can be formulated as minimization of the largest ratio of gap size to ingest time,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorT - \colorTbar} \text{ for } \colorTbar < \colorT.
\end{align*}

The approximate lower bound on best-case gap size ratio provided in Equation \ref{eqn:approx-gap-bound} for the stretched curation can also be applied to tilted curation, as can the strict bound on best-case gap size ratio acounting for discretiztion effects established Theorem \ref{thm:stretched-ideal-strict}.

In this section, we present a stream curation algorithm tailored to the tilted criterion, achieving maximum gap size ratio no worse than
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorT - \colorTbar}
  &\leq
  \frac{
    1
  }{
    \max\Big(
      \frac{\colorS}{2(\colort + \colors)},\;\;
      \frac{\colorS}{4\colort},\;\;
      \frac{\colorS}{2^{\colors - \colortau - 1}}
    \Big)
    - 1/2
  }.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Tilted Algorithm Strategy}
\label{sec:tilted-strategy}

\input{fig/hsurf-tilted-intuition.tex}

The retention strategy for the tilted algorithm strongly resembles that of the stretched algorithm.
Recall that under the stretched algorithm the first $n(\colorT)$ data items of each hanoi value $\colorH(\colorTbar)$ are retained, with $n(\colorT)$ degrading with time in shifting from many copies of few encountered hanoi values to few copies of many encountered hanoi values.
Under the tilted algorithm, we instead keep the \textit{last} $n(\colorT)$ data items of each hanoi value.
Figure \ref{fig:hanoi-intuition-tilted} shows how keeping the last $n$ instances of each \hv{} approximates tilted distribution.

We thus define our algorithmic goal as maintaining --- for a declining threshold $n(\colorT)$ --- the set of data items,
\begin{align*}
\\
\textsf{goal\_tilted}
&\coloneq
\bigcup_{\colorh \in [0 \twodots \left\lfloor \log_2(\colorT + 1) \right\rfloor]}
\{ \colorTbar =
\eqnmarkbox[WildStrawberry]{maxhanoi}{
  \left\lfloor
  \frac{\colorT - 2^{\colorh} + 1}{2^{\colorh + 1}}
  \right\rfloor
  2^{\colorh + 1}
  + 2^{\colorh}
  - 1
}
- i2^{\colorh + 1} \text{ for } i \in [0 \twodots n(\colorT) - 1] : \colorTbar \geq 0 \}.
\end{align*}

\annotate[yshift=1em]{above,left}{maxhanoi}{$\max\{
  \colorTbar' \in [0 \twodots \colorT] : \colorH(\colorTbar') = \colorh
\}$}

Note also that by construction, $\textsf{goal\_tilted} \subset \{ \colorTbar \in [0 \twodots \colorT] \}$.
It can be shown analogously to the stretched algorithm's Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-first-n-space} that setting $n(\colorT) \coloneq 2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau}$ suffices to respect available buffer capacity $\colorS$ under the tilted algorithm.

\subsection{Tilted Algorithm Mechanism}
\label{sec:tilted-mechanism}

Because the tilted algorithm, like the stretched algorithm, also follows an equal-$n$-per-\hv{} scheme, hanoi value reservation layout is maintained identically to the stretched algorithm's segment-based scheme.
Refer to Section \ref{sec:stretched-mechanism} for a detailed description and justification of this hanoi value reservation layout, and how it is unfolds across epochs $0 \leq \colort \leq \colorS - \colors$.

A pertinent result of the stretched layout, though, is that the at least $2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau}$ data item instances of each \hv{} are retained (Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-discarded-incidence-count}).
However, unlike the stretched algorithm, for the tilted algorithm we wish to keep the \textit{last} $n$ rather than the \textit{first} $n$ instances of each hanoi value.
We can do that by continuing to write data items for each \hv{} into buffer sites reserved for that \hv{} after they initially fill --- overwriting older instances of the \hv{} to keep a ``ring buffer'' of fresh \hv{} instances.

Supplemental materials prove several results related to the tilted algorithm's ring buffer mechanism --- notably, including that fill cycles align evenly to epoch and meta-epoch transitions (Lemma \ref{thm:tilted-last-touched}).
These results build to Lemma \ref{thm:tilted-most-recent-retained}, which confirms that our strategy always preserves the last $2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau}$ instances of each hanoi value.
We take particular care in considering transitions where the ``ring buffer'' of sites reserved to a \hv{} is halved by growth of invading segments.

\subsection{Tilted Algorithm Implementation}
\label{sec:tilted-implementation}

\input{fig/hsurf-tilted-implementation.tex}

Site selection for data ingest proceeds similarly to that of the stretched algorithm, described in Section \ref{sec:stretched} -- with the exception that, instead of discarding data items once available sites reserved to that \hv{} have filled, we simply cycle back and overwrite data items within that \hv{}'s reservations in the order that they were added.
In practice, the target index among available sites reserved to a \hv{} can be calculated as the number of previous times a \hv{} has been encountered before time $\colorT$, modulus the number of sites reserved to that hanoi value.
Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-stretched-implementation-schematic} illustrates site selection over epochs $\colort \in \{0,1,2\}$ on buffer size $\colorS=32$.

Ingestion time calculation for lookup of the data item at buffer site $\colork$ at time $\colorT$ can be accomplished by decoding that site's segment index and checking whether (if slated) it has yet been replaced during the current epoch $\colort$.
Both site selection and ingest time calculation can be accomplished through fast $\mathcal{O}(1)$ binary operations (e.g., bit mask, bit shift, count leading zeros).
We refer the reader to our supplemental Python-language implementation for an exact step-by-step listing of both operations for the tilted algorithm.

\subsection{Tilted Algorithm Criterion Satisfaction}
\label{sec:tilted-satisfaction}

In this final subsection, we establish an upper bound on gap size ratio $\colorg/(\colorT - \colorTbar)$ for a buffer of size $\colorS$ at time $\colorT$ under the proposed tilted curation algorithm.

\input{thm/tilted-gap-size}

During early epoch $\colort = 1$, $\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)/(\colorT - \colorTbar) \leq 4/\colorS$.
Likewise, during the last supported meta-epoch $\colortau = \colors - 1$, $\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)/(\colorT - \colorTbar) \leq 2$.
Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-tilted-implementation-satisfaction} shows algorithm performance on the stretched criterion for buffer size $\colorS=16$, $\colorT \in [0\twodots 2^{\colorS} - 1)$.
