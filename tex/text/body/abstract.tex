\begin{abstract}
In working with data streams, it is often necessary to continuously retain a representative record of data collected across elapsed history.
This objective requires efficient mechanisms to aggregate or summarize history on an online basis.
Here, we address the problem of extracting a fixed-capacity, rolling subsample from a data stream.
Our proposed ``DStream'' approach generalizes the ring buffer --- which ordinarily provides rolling last-$n$ coverage --- to instead maintain rolling steady coverage, where retained items spread evenly across elapsed data stream history.
Comparing our approach against existing work by Zhao and Zhang (2006), we measure between a $2.5\times$ and $72\times$ speedup in data stream processing.
We also demonstrate substantial memory savings for scenarios where stored data items are small --- more than 30-fold, for instance, with single-bit data items.
Empirically, we find equivalent or superior behavior in maintaining steady coverage; we also prove worst-case bounds on rolling coverage quality.
We further show processing time to be hard $O(1)$, with respect to both buffer capacity and stream depth.
As such, we expect presented work to be particularly valuable in domains that are resource-constrained (e.g., embedded systems) or performance-critical (e.g., real-time).
To facilitate practical applications, we accompany our presentation with plug-and-play, open-source algorithm implementations.
