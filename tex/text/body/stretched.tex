\section{Stretched Algorithm} \label{sec:stretched}

The stretched criterion favors early data items, targeting a record with gap sizes proportional to data item ingest time $\colorTbar$.
As given in Equation \ref{eqn:stretched-cost} in Section \ref{sec:stream-curation-problem}, the stretched criterion's cost function is the largest ratio of gap size to ingest time,
\begin{align*}
\max\Big\{\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar} : \colorTbar \in [1 \twodots \colorT)\Big\}.
\end{align*}
For buffer size $\colorS$ and time elapsed $\colorT$, ideal retention would space retained items so that gap size grows proportionally to $\colorTbar$.
Under such a layout, spacing between data items would scale exponentially, and --- counting from zero --- the $n$th retained data item would have ingestion time $\colorT^{n/(\colorS - 1)}$.
Deriving an approximate bound without accounting for discretization effects, gap size ratio would be minimized at best,
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:approx-gap-bound}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar}
&\stackrel{\sim}{\geq}
\colorT^{1/\colorS} - 1
\text{ for }
\colorTbar > 0.
\end{align}

Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-ideal-strict} works in discretization to prove a strict lower bound on gap size ratio,
\begin{align}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar}
\geq
\frac{
  1
}{
  1 + \colorS
  - \left\lfloor \colorS \log_{\colorT}\Big(
    (\colorT - \colorS)(\colorT^{1/\colorS} - 1) + 1
  \Big)\right\rfloor
}
\geq
\frac{
  1
}{
  1 + \colorS
}
\text{ for }
\colorTbar > 0.
\label{eqn:stretched-best}
\end{align}

This section proposes a stream curation algorithm tailored to the stretched criterion, achieving gap size ratios no worse than
\begin{align}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar}
&\leq
\min\Big(
  \frac{2^{\colortau + 1}}{\colorS},\;\;
  \frac{2(\colort + \colors)}{\colorS},\;\;
  \frac{4\colort}{\colorS}
\Big)
\text{ for }
\colorTbar > 0
\label{eqn:stretchednoworse}
\end{align}
over supported epochs $\colort \in [0\twodots\colorS - \colors)$.
This bound ensures gap size ratio ${\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}/{\colorTbar} \leq 1$.
More generally, guarantees gap size ratio can be shown guaranteed within a factor of $(1 + 1/\colorS)\times\min(2\colort + 2\colors, \;\; 4\colort, \;\; 2^{\colortau + 1})$ times the optimal bound established in Equation \ref{eqn:stretched-best}.

\subsection{Stretched Algorithm Strategy}
\label{sec:stretched-strategy}

As with the steady algorithm, processing data items $\colorTbar$ based on their hanoi value $\colorH(\colorTbar)$ provides the backbone of our approach to stretched curation.
However, instead of keeping just the $m$ highest \hv{}'s encountered, we approximate a stretched distribution by keeping the first $n$ instances of all encountered \hv{}'s.
Figure \ref{fig:hanoi-intuition-stretched} shows how keeping the first $n$ instances of each \hv{} approximates stretched distribution.

To respect fixed buffer capacity, per-\hv{} capacity $n$ must degrade as we encounter new \hv{}'s.
We thus set out to maintain -- for a declining threshold $n(\colorT)$ --- the set of data items,
\begin{align*}
\textsf{goal\_stretched}
&\coloneq
\bigcup_{\colorh \geq 0}
\{ \colorTbar = i2^{\colorh + 1} + 2^{\colorh} - 1 \text{ for } i \in [0 \twodots n(\colorT) - 1] : \colorTbar < \colorT \}.
% \quad
% \forall \colorh \in \{ \colorH(\colorTbar) \forall \colorTbar \leq \colorT \}
\end{align*}
The set $\textsf{goal\_stretched}$ is constructed as a union of the smallest $n(\colorT)$ instances of each \hv{}, excluding those not yet encountered at current time $\colorTbar$.
By construction, $\textsf{goal\_stretched} \subset [0 \twodots \colorT)$.
Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-first-n-space} shows setting $n(\colorT) \coloneq 2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau}$ suffices to respect available buffer capacity $\colorS$.

% Note that, by the nature of the hanoi sequence, the distinct \hv{}'s encountered by time $\colorTbar$, $\{ \colorH(\colorTbar) \forall \colorTbar \leq \colorT \}$, , equals $[0 \twodots \left\lfloor \log_2\colorT + 1 \right\rfloor]\}$.

\subsection{Stretched Algorithm Mechanism}
\label{sec:stretched-mechanism}

\input{fig/hsurf-stretched-implementation.tex}

Be reminded that our stretched retention plan is to guarantee space for the first $n(\colorT) =  2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau}$ instances of each hanoi value.
A naive layout might reserve a full $n(\colorT)$ sites for all $2^{\colors + \colort}$ \hv{}'s $\colorh$ that have been encountered by time $\colorT$.
However, such a naive approach would exceed available buffer capacity.
For example, at $\colortau=\colort=0$,
\begin{align*}
2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau} \times 2^{\colors + \colort}
&\geq
2^{2\colors - 1}\\
&\geq
\frac{\colorS^{2}}{2}\\
&> \colorS \text{ for } \colorS > 1.
\end{align*}
A more sophisticated approach will be needed, which we develop next.

\subsubsection{Stretched Algorithm Layout at $\colort,\colortau=0$}

In motivating a more apt stretched layout strategy, begin by restricting focus to epoch $\colort=\colortau=0$, where $\colorT < \colorS$.
Assume that we assign one site to each data item $0\leq \colorTbar < \colorS$ and arrange site assignments according to \hv{} $\colorh = \colorH(\colorTbar)$.
Suppose organization of reserved sites into contiguous segments, with no two items in the same segment allowed to share the same hanoi value $\colorh$.

Under this scheme, we will have at least $\colorS/2$ segments --- one per \hv{} $\colorh=0$ instance encountered.
In constructing segments, half of these $\colorh=0$ segments can be augmented with a site to house one of the $\colorS/4$ \hv{} $\colorh=1$ data items.
We can continue, and further augment $\colorS/8$ segments with \hv{} $\colorh=2$, etc.
Continuing this pattern to place all encountered \hv{} $\colorh\leq\colors$ yields segment sizes that turn out to recapitulate the hanoi sequence.
Special-casing the largest segment, constructed segment sizes can be enumerated as
\begin{align}
\colors + 1,\;\; \colorH(0) + 1,\;\; \colorH(1) + 1,\;\; \ldots,\;\; \colorH(\colorS/2 - 2) + 1.
\label{eqn:stretched-segment-sizes}
\end{align}
These segment sizes can be shown to exactly fill available buffer space $\colorS$,
\begin{align*}
\colors + 1
+  \sum_{\colorh = 0}^{\colors - 2}
2^{\colors - 2 - \colorh} \times (\colorh + 1)
&=
\colors + 1 +
2^{\colors} - \colors - 1
\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}
\colorS.
\end{align*}

Thus far, we have only considered segment sizes --- and not discussed the arrangement of segment order within buffer space $\colorS$.
One naive approach would simply order segments by length, as previously in Section \ref{sec:steady}.
However, as we will see shortly, it turns out that adopting the hanoi sequence's natural ordering (as done in Formula \ref{eqn:stretched-segment-sizes}) better serves our objectives.
The bottom row (``epoch 0'') of Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-stretched-intuition-reservations} shows application of this layout strategy to a 32-site buffer, with segments sized and arranged directly as enumerated in Formula \ref{eqn:stretched-segment-sizes}.

\subsubsection{Stretched Algorithm Layout at $\colort,\colortau\geq1$}

What about $\colorT \geq \colorS$ (i.e., $\colort \geq 1$)?
At epoch $\colort=\colortau=0$, we have successfully guaranteed $n(\colorT) = 2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau} = \colorS / 2$ reserved sites per hanoi value.
To satisfy $\textsf{goal\_stretched}$ at $\colort=\colortau=1$, we only need to guarantee $n(\colorT) = \colorS/4$ reserved sites --- half as many as at $\colort=\colortau=0$.
So, half of our $S/2$ sites reserved to \hv{} $\colorh=0$ may be freed up.
One way to do this is by releasing all singleton segments containing \textit{only} \hv{} $\colorh=0$.

Because singleton segments intersperse all other segments, their elimination makes space for all remaining segments to ``invade'' by growing one site.
Sticking with our convention of at most one site with each \hv{} $\colorh$ per reservation segment, invading segments accrue space to host an additional high hanoi value data item.
For instance, the largest segment will grow a site reserved to \hv{} $\colorh=\colors +1$.
Two reservation sites will be added for \hv{} $\colorh=\colors - 1$, four for \hv{} $\colorh=\colors - 2$, etc. --- crucially, mirroring the incidence counts for these \hv{}'s during epoch $\colort=1$.

In subsequent epochs $\colort>1$, we can continue dissolving the smallest, innermost-nested reservation segments to grow capacity for new high-\hv{} data items.
Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-stretched-intuition-reservations} shows several steps through this ``invasion'' process on a 32-site buffer.
At final epoch $\colort=\colorS-\colors - 1$ (i.e., $\colorT \approx 2^{\colorS - 1}$), the proposed process of progressive, nested segment subsumption culminates to a single reservation segment containing one site for each \hv{} $0 \leq \colorh < \colorS$.

We will next show that meta-epochs $\colortau$, as defined earlier in Section \ref{sec:notation-metaepoch}, correspond precisely to the timing with which successive inner segments are subsumed.

\input{thm/stretched-meta-epoch.tex}

With relationship between segment subsumption and meta-epoch $\colortau$ thus established, Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-discarded-incidence-count} shows that our scheme maintains reservation layout sufficient to accommodate at least $n(\colorT) = 2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau}$ items of each hanoi value.

\subsubsection{Stretched Algorithm Implementation}
\label{sec:stretched-implementation}

Having determined reservation segment layout strategy, the remaining details of site selection can be addressed succinctly.

As we encounter data items with $\colorH(\colorTbar) = \colorh$, we fill reserved sites for that item's \hv{} in descending order of initialized segment size $r$.
Among same-size segments, we simply fill from left to right.
As invasion eliminates the smallest initialized segments first, this approach guarantees retention of the oldest data items with $\colorH(\colorTbar) = \colorh$.
We may thus reinterpret Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-discarded-incidence-count} as providing guarantees on the first $n$ instances of each \hv{} retained.
Once sites reserved to \hv{} $\colorh$ fill, it is necessary to discard further instances $\colorH(\colorTbar) = \colorh$ without storage.
Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-stretched-implementation-schematic} illustrates the resulting site selection process $\colorK(\colorT)$ over epochs $\colort \in \{0,1,2\}$ on an example buffer, size $\colorS=32$.
Algorithm \ref{alg:stretched-site-selection} provides a step-by-step listing of the stretched site selection procedure $\colorK(\colorT)$, which is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

\input{alg/stretched-site-selection}

Stretched site lookup $\colorL(\colorT)$ is provided in supplementary material, as Algorithm \ref{alg:stretched-time-lookup}.
Reference Python implementations appear in Supplementary Listings \ref{lst:stretched_site_selection.py} and \ref{lst:stretched_time_lookup.py}, as well as accompanying tests.
The data item $\colorTbar$ present at buffer site $\colork$ at time $\colorT$ can be determined by decoding that site's segment index and checking whether (if slated) it has yet been replaced during the current epoch $\colort$.
Both site selection and ingest time calculation can be accomplished through fast $\mathcal{O}(1)$ binary operations (e.g., bit mask, bit shift, count leading zeros, popcount).

\subsection{Stretched Algorithm Criterion Satisfaction}
\label{sec:stretched-satisfaction}

In this final subsection, we establish an upper bound on gap size ratio $\colorg / \colorTbar$ for a buffer of size $\colorS$ at time $\colorT$ under the proposed stretched curation algorithm.

\input{thm/stretched-gap-size}

During early epoch $\colort = 1$, $\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)/\colorTbar \leq 4/\colorS$.
Likewise, at the opposite extremum, $\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)/\colorTbar \leq 1$ during the last supported meta-epoch $\colortau = \colors - 1$.
Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-stretched-implementation-satisfaction} shows algorithm performance on the stretched criterion for buffer size $\colorS=16$, $\colorT \in [0\twodots 2^{\colorS} - 1)$.
