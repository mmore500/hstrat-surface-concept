\section{Stretched Algorithm} \label{sec:stretched}

The stretched criterion seeks to retain data items spaced out across observed history proportionally to data item age $\colorTbar$.
The criterion can be formulated as minimization of the largest gap size ratio,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar} \text{ for } \colorTbar > 0.
\end{align*}
For a buffer size $\colorS$ and time elapsed $\colorT$, the ideal retention would space retained data items at the geometric ratio $\colorT^{1/\colorS}$ so that, counting from zero, the $n$th retained data item has ingestion time $\colorT^{n/(\colorS - 1)}$.
Neglecting discretization, gap size ratio can be minimized at best approximately
\begin{align*}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar}
&\stackrel{\sim}{\geq}
\colorT^{1/\colorS} - 1.
\end{align*}

Accounting for discretization effects provides a strict lower bound on gap size ratio, presented in Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-ideal-strict}.

\input{thm/stretched-ideal-strict}

This section presents a stream curation algorithm designed to support the stretched criterion, achieving maximum gap size no worse than,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar}
&\leq
\min\Big(
  \frac{2(\colort + \colors)}{\colorS},
  \frac{4\colort}{\colorS}
\Big).
\end{align*}

Unlike the steady algorithm presented in Section \ref{sec:steady}, which supports indevinitely many data ingestions $\colorT$, our proposed stretched algorithm only supports $2^{\colorS}$ ingestions.
Note that for even modestly sized buffers, this limitation is unlikely to arise in practice.
A 64-site buffer, for instance, could ingest data items at a rate of 4GHz for before reaching this data item cap.
Extension of the stretched algorithm beyond epoch $\colort = \colorS - \colors$ remains for future work.

\subsection{Criterion Satisfaction}

In this final subsection, we establish an upper bound on gap size $\colorg$ for a buffer of size $\colorS$ at time $\colorT$ under the proposed stretched curation algorithm.

Consideration of the gap size bound result found in Theorem \ref{thm:stretched-gap-size} at small and large $\colort$ is instructive.
During the first epoch where $\colort = 1$,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar}
\leq
\frac{4}{\colorS}.
\end{align*}

Likewise, during the last supported epoch, where $\colort = \colorS - \colors$,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\colorG_{\colorT}(\colorTbar)}{\colorTbar}
\leq
2.
\end{align*}
