\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Efficient operations over data streams are critical in harnessing the ever-increasing volume and velocity of data generation.
Formally, a data stream is considered to be composed of a strictly-ordered sequence of read-once inputs.
Such streams' ordering may be dictated by inherently real-time processes (e.g., physical sensor inputs) or by access patterns for physical storage media (e.g., a tape archive) \citep{henzinger1998computing}.
They may also result from non-reversible computations (e.g., forward-time simulation) \citep{abdulla2004simulation,schutzel2014stream}.
Work with data streams assumes input greatly exceeds memory capacity, with streams often simply treated as unbounded \citep{jiang2006research}.
Indeed, real-world computing often requires real-time operations on a continuous, indefinite basis \citep{cordeiro2016online}.
Notable application domains involving data streams include sensor networks \citep{elnahrawy2003research}, distributed big-data processing \citep{he2010comet}, real-time network traffic analysis \citep{johnson2005streams,muthukrishnan2005data}, systems log management \citep{fischer2012real}, fraud monitoring \citep{rajeshwari2016real}, trading in financial markets \citep{agarwal2009faster}, environmental monitoring \citep{hill2009real}, and astronomy \citep{graham2012data}.

Here, we focus specifically on subsampling over data streams and introduce three $\mathcal{O}(1)$ ``DownStream'' algorithms for space-efficient curation of data items:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item \textit{evenly covering} elapsed history (``\textit{steady}'' algorithm, Section \ref{sec:steady}),
\item \textit{skewed older} over elapsed history (``\textit{stretched}'' algorithm, Section \ref{sec:stretched}), or
\item \textit{newer newer} over elapsed history (``\textit{tilted}'' algorithm, Section \ref{sec:tilted}).
\end{enumerate*}
Together, these algorithms support a variety of use cases differing in what data is prioritized.
Figure \ref{fig:criteria-intuition} compares steady, stretched, and tilted retention.

For each algorithm, we demonstrate worst-case bounds on error in curated collection composition.
We refer to this rolling subset problem as ``data stream curation,'' which we will define next.
