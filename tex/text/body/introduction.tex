\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Efficient operations over data streams are critical in harnessing the ever-increasing volume and velocity of data generation.
Formally, a data stream is considered to be composed of a strictly-ordered sequence of read-once inputs.
Such streams' ordering may be dictated by inherently real-time processes (e.g., physical sensor inputs) or by access patterns for physical storage media (e.g., a tape archive) \citep{henzinger1998computing}.
They may also result from non-reversible computations (e.g., forward-time simulation) \citep{abdulla2004simulation,schutzel2014stream}.
Work with data streams assumes input greatly exceeds memory capacity, with streams often treated as unbounded \citep{jiang2006research}.
Indeed, real-world computing often requires real-time operations on a continuous, indefinite basis \citep{cordeiro2016online}.
Notable application domains involving data streams include sensor networks \citep{elnahrawy2003research}, distributed big-data processing \citep{he2010comet}, real-time network traffic analysis \citep{johnson2005streams,muthukrishnan2005data}, systems log management \citep{fischer2012real}, fraud monitoring \citep{rajeshwari2016real}, trading in financial markets \citep{agarwal2009faster}, environmental monitoring \citep{hill2009real}, and astronomy \citep{graham2012data}.

Here, we focus specifically on subsampling over data streams and introduce an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ algorithms for space-efficient curation of data items \textit{evenly covering} elapsed history.
We call this algorithm the \textit{steady} ``DStream'' algorithm.
Figure \ref{fig:criteria-intuition} shows an example of ideal ideal steady retention.
Among other results, we demonstrate worst-case bounds on error in curated collection composition under the steady algorithm.
We refer to this rolling subset problem as ``data stream curation,'' which we will define next.

Although not covered here, in other preliminary work we have also investigated ``DStream'' algorithms that \textit{skew older} over elapsed history (``\textit{stretched}'' algorithm), or \textit{skew newer} over elapsed history (``\textit{tilted}'' algorithm) \citep{moreno2024structured}.
Together, these algorithms support a variety of use cases differing in what data is prioritized.
