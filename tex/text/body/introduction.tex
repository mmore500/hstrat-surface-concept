\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Efficient operations over data streams are critical in harnessing ever-increasing volume and velocity of data generation.
Formally, a data stream is considered to comprise a strictly-ordered sequences of read-once inputs.
Such streams' ordering may be dictated by inherently real-time processes (e.g., physical sensor inputs) or by access patterns for physical storage media (e.g., a tape archive) \citep{henzinger1998computing}.
They may also result from non-reversible computations (e.g., forward-time simulation) \citep{abdulla2004simulation,schutzel2014stream}.
Work with data streams assumes input greatly exceeds memory capacity, with streams often simply treated as unbounded \citep{jiang2006research}.
Indeed, real-world computing often requires real-time operations on a continuous, indefinite basis \citep{cordeiro2016online}.
Notable application domains involving data streams include sensor networks \citep{elnahrawy2003research}, big-data analytics \citep{he2010comet}, real-time network traffic analysis \citep{johnson2005streams,muthukrishnan2005data}, systems administration \citep{fischer2012real}, financial analytics \citep{rajeshwari2016real,agarwal2009faster}, environment monitoring \citep{hill2009real}, and astronomy \citep{graham2012data}.

Here, we focus on just one possible operation over data streams: subsampling, and develop $\mathcal{O}(1)$ operations for space-efficient curation of data subsets comprising either
\begin{enumerate}
\item even composition over sequence history (``steady''),
\item early-biased composition (``stretched''), or
\item recency-biased composition (``tilted'').
\end{enumerate}
For each algorithm, we demonstrate worst-case bounds on error in curated collection composition.
We refer to this rolling subset problem as ``data stream curation,'' which we will define next.
