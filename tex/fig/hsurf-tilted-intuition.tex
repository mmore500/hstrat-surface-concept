    \textbf{Tilted algorithm strategy.}

    Schematic shows placement strategy for data items with hanoi value $\colorH(\colorTbar) = 0$ on a buffer of size $\colorS=8$.
    During epoch 0, an initial data item is placed at each buffer site juast as under the stretched algorithm strategy (Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-stretched-intuition}).
    The tilted strategy differs from stretched in that during epoch 1, subsequent \hv{} 0 data items continue to be placed in available \hv{} 0 reservation sites.
    In this way, the last --- as opposed to first --- data items corresponding to each hanoi value are kept.
  % Because the distribution of segment lengths mirrors the hanoi sequence, buffer space becomes available for the first-seen instances of high hanoi values as they are encountered.
    Each epoch, all invaded sites share the same hanoi value, causing the available reservation sites for that \hv{} to instantaneously halve.
    So, placements for a particular \hv{} cycle around available reservation sites, and then continue cycling around remaining sites after the \hv{} is invaded and half of reservation sites for that \hv{} are ceded.
    Invasion is sequenced to correspond cleanly with the cycle returning to segment 0 after filling to-be-eliminated sites.
    Subsequent overwrites of data items at ceded reservation sites occur slowly enough to ensure that, with $n$ remaining reservation sites, the $n$ most recent \hv{} data items are retained as remaining sites are refilled.
  In this manner, this layout strategy approximates the last-$n$ \hv{} strategy depicted in Figure \ref{fig:hanoi-intuition-tilted}, with $n$ decreasing to respect available buffer space as segments are invaded and lost (just as for the stretched algorithm, Figure \ref{fig:hsurf-stretched-intuition-reservations}).
