      \textbf{Core stream curation algorithm operations.}
      \footnotesize
      The ingest site selection operation (operation shown as \textit{item ``a''}) takes the current time $\colorT$ and determines the buffer site $\colork$ to store the ingested data item.
      Data items may also be discarded without storage, as are $\colorTbar=4$ and $\colorTbar=6$ in this example.
      This operation is performed when storing data into a curated buffer, once for each data item received from the data stream.
      Data is not moved after it is stored.
      The ingested time calculation operation (operation shown as \textit{item ``b''}) provides the previous time $\colorTbar$ when the data item present at buffer site $\colork$ was ingested, given the current time $\colorT$.
      This operation is performed when reading data from a curated buffer in order to identify the provenance of stored data.
      Note that which data item $\colorTbar$ occupies a buffer site $\colork$ at time $\colorT$ results solely from the sequence of ingest storage sites selected up to that point.
      As such, the site lookup operation $\colorL$ can be considered, in a loose sense, as ``decoding'' or ``inverse'' to the site selection operation $\colorK$.
      Panels with diamond markers on the right show curated collection composition at $\colorT=4$ and $\colorT=8$.
      Figure \ref{fig:criteria-intuition} shows the target ``steady'' curated collection compositionsconsidered in this work.
      An animated time-lapses of ingests under algorithm targeting steady collection composition is viewable at \url{https://hopth.ru/du}.
