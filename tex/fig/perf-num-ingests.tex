\textbf{Per-item walltime for curation from 10k- and 1M-item single-bit data streams.}
Proposed DownStream algorithm is ``dstream steady;''
``Online equi-segmented scheme`` from \citep{zhao2005generalized} is ``naive steady.''
For both approaches, per-item walltime increases where buffer size is a larger fraction of data stream length, as a higher fraction of items are stored rather than discarded.
Timings for maintaining a simple ring buffer and no-store processing are included as controls.
For longer 1M-item data streams, per-item walltime for DownStream approach is nearly equivalent to no-store control.
Shaded bands behind lines represent bootstrapped 95\% CI over 40 replicate timings.
