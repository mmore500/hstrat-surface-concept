  Top panel \ref{fig:hsurf-steady-implementation-schematic} summarizes how data items are ingested and retained over time within a 32-site buffer, color-coded by data items' conceptual ingestion order hanoi values $\colorH(\colorT)$.
  Between $\colorT=0$ and $\colorT=127$, time is segmented into conceptual epochs $\colort=0$, $\colort=1$, and $\colort=2$.
  Spliced-in strips show hanoi values assigned to each buffer site for the upcoming epoch, separated into conceptual ``reservation'' groups by vertical black lines.
  Reservation groups occur in five ``bunches'' --- (1) one 5-site reservation group, (2) one 4-site reservation group, (3) two 3-site groups, (4) four 2-site groups, and (5) eight 1-site groups.
  At each epoch, data items are filled into sites newly-assigned for their ingestion-order hanoi value from left-to-right.
  In epoch 0, all sites are filled with a first data item.
  At subsequent epochs, successive hanoi values are assigned one site per group in each bunch, with each hanoi value filling into one bunch per epoch.
  All newly-assigned sites were previously assigned to the overall now-lowest hanoi value.
  In this way, all instances of the overall lowest hanoi value are overwritten each epoch.
  Heatmap panel \ref{fig:hsurf-steady-implementation-dripplot} shows evolution of data item age at each sites on a 256-bit field over the course of 4,096 time steps.
  Bottom panel \ref{fig:hsurf-steady-implementation-heatmap} shows retention spans for 3,000 ingested time points.
  Vertical lines span durations between ingestion and elimination for data items from successive time points.
  Time points previously eliminated are marked in red.
  Note that time elapses from bottom to top in all visualizations.
