    Top panel \ref{fig:hsurf-steady-intuition-diagram} shows sites selected for itmes with \hv{} $\colorh$ from their first occurance during epoch $\colort=\colorh-4$ to epoch $\colort=\colorh+1$, when stored instances of that \hv{} are overwritten.
    Available memory buffer sites are shown across the bottom of the schematic.
    Data items' vertical span provides a timeline from when they are stored to when they are overwritten.
    The first data item with hanoi value $\colorH(\colorT) = \colorh$ is placed in segment $\colort=\colorh-4$.
    The next data item with \hv{} $\colorh$ is encountered in the following epoch, and it is placed in bunch 1.
    In epoch $\colort=\colorh-1$, two data items with \hv{} $\colorh$ are encountered and placed into segments within bunch 2.
    Epoch $\colort=\colorh-1$, encounters 4 data items with \hv{} $\colorh-1$ places them in bunch 3 segments.
    In epoch $\colort=\colorh$, eight \hv{} $\colorh$ data items (twice as many) are encountered.
    We place them in bunch 4's one-site segments.
    Finally, during epoch $\colort=\colorh+1$, incoming data items with \hv{} $\colorh$ discarded and all stored \hv{} $\colorh$ items are overwritten.
    In this manner, data items with highest \hv{} are retained on a rolling basis to provide uniformly-spaced gaps --- as laid out in Figure \ref{fig:hanoi-intuition-steady}.
    Bottom panel \ref{fig:hsurf-steady-intuition-heatmap} shows \hv{} site reservations $\colorHcal_{\colort}(\colork)$ from epoch $\colort=0$ through $\colort=5$ with buffer size $\colorS=16$.
    Numbering/color coding corresponds to \hv{} a site is reserved for.
    Segments are separated by black dividers; bunches are not explicitly indicated.
    Note that rightmost site $\colork=\colorS-1$ is unused.
