\begin{lemma}[Hanoi Value Delta Between Invader and Invaded]
\label{thm:tilted-invader-minus-invaded}
Where $\colorHcal_{\colort + 1}(\colork) \neq \colorHcal_{\colort}(\colork)$, $\colorHcal_{\colort + 1}(\colork) - \colorHcal_{\colort}(\colork) \geq 2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\colorHcal_{\colort + 1}(\colork) - \colorHcal_{\colort}(\colork) \leq 1$.
Note that, by construction, any invasion extends the invading segment by at least one site.
Then, it would be the case that $\exists \colort$ prior to invasion such that the the invaded segment is larger or equal in size to the invading segment.
However, this cannot be the case --- by construction, segments slated for invasion are always the strictly smallest among remaining segments.
\end{proof}
