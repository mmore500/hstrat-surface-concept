\begin{lemma}[Monotonicity of Hanoi Value Reservation $\colorHcal(\colork)$ for Buffer Site $\colork$]
\label{thm:tilted-invader-minus-invaded}
A site's assigned hanoi value reservation never decreases.
Where it increases, it does so by at least 2.
Formally, where $\colorHcal_{\colort + 1}(\colork) \neq \colorHcal_{\colort}(\colork)$,
\begin{align*}
\colorHcal_{\colort + 1}(\colork) - \colorHcal_{\colort}(\colork) \geq 2.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By design, invasion of any segment begins at the segment's leftmost site $\colork$, always assigned $\colorHcal(\colork) = 0$.
Because singleton $r=0$ reservation segments never invade, the invader of this leftmost $\colorh = 0$ site will always stem from a segment $r \geq 1$ and have h.v. $\colorh > 1$.
The delta $\colorHcal_{\colort + 1}(\colork) - \colorHcal_{\colort}(\colork) \geq 2$ remains constant over subsequent invasion steps because invader and invaded h.v.'s both increment by exactly 1 each epoch (until complete elimination of the invaded segment).
\end{proof}
