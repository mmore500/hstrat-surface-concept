\begin{theorem}[Tilted algorithm gap size ratio upper bound]
\label{thm:tilted-gap-size}
Under the tilted curation algorithm, gap size ratio is bounded per Equation \ref{eqn:tilted-gap-size-bound}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

From Lemma \ref{thm:gap-size-ratio-tilted}, we have that if the first $n$ instances of each \hv{} $\colorh$ are retained then gap size ratio is bounded below by $1/(n - 1/2)$.
Substituting expressions for the number of sites reserved per \hv{} $n$ from Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-discarded-incidence-count} and Corollary \ref{thm:stretched-reservation-count} gives the result.
\end{proof}
