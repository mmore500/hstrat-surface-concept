\begin{theorem}[Stretched algorithm gap size ratio upper bound]
\label{thm:stretched-gap-size}
Under the stretched curation algorithm, gap size ratio is bounded according to Equation \ref{eqn:stretchednoworse}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

Lemma \ref{thm:gap-size-ratio-stretched} establishes that gap size ratio is bounded below by $1/n$ if the first $n$ instances of each \hv{} $\colorh$ are retained.
Substituting expressions for the number of sites reserved per \hv{} derived in Lemma \ref{thm:stretched-discarded-incidence-count} and Corrolary \ref{thm:stretched-reservation-count} gives
\begin{align*}
  \mathsf{cost\_stretched}(\colorTbar)
  &\leq
  \Big[
    \max\Big(
      2^{\colors - 1 - \colortau},\;\;
      \frac{\colorS}{2(\colort + \colors)},\;\;
      \frac{\colorS}{4\colort}
    \Big)
  \Big]^{-1}.
\end{align*}

Simplifying resolves the result.

\end{proof}
